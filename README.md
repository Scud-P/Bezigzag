# Bezigzag
An Android Studio app to count points at the "Bézigue" card game

# Context
Aspiring to become a programmer because my marketing job didn't challenge me anymore.
I did a lot of research about OOP, learnt the basics of Python and Java but finally decided it was time to get my brain and hands dirty.
Inspired by a good friend who could never count the points right while we played card games, I decided to make her life easier so we could finally know who won and by what margin at the end of the game.
Since most of my circle of friends' phones run on android, I decided to start experimenting with Android Studio.
I then had to chose between Kotlin and Java, but since I had already followed many tutorials during my ongoing learning, and had most fun with Java, I went with it!

# The App itself
The menu alllows to:
- Display the rules of the card game
- Switch all the copŷ from English to French (it IS a French game after all...)
- Start a new game

The players can then perform different actions, like awarding points depending on the melds they declare and ending a round to award bonus points when the two game phases end.
If one or both players reach the 1500 points mark at the end of the turn, the winner and his score are announced and the game ends!
